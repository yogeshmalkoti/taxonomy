      **Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah** (All from 9 and the last from 10) is a Sutra used for multiplication, particularly when both numbers are close to a power of 10. For example, to multiply 98 × 97, subtract both numbers from 100 (giving 2 and 3), multiply the differences (2 × 3 = 6), and subtract that from 10000 to get the answer 9604. This Sutra simplifies multiplication without requiring long multiplication methods.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the "Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah" Sutra used for?
        answer: |
          The "Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah" Sutra is used for multiplying numbers that are close to a base, such as 10, 100, or 1000. It simplifies the multiplication process by subtracting from the base and multiplying the differences.
      - question: |
          How do you apply the "Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah" Sutra to multiply 98 and 97?
        answer: |
          To multiply 98 × 97, subtract each number from 100 (getting 2 and 3), multiply the differences (2 × 3 = 6), and subtract this from 10000, resulting in 9604.
      - question: |
          Why is the "Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah" Sutra effective for multiplication?
        answer: |
          The Sutra is effective for multiplying numbers near a power of 10 because it transforms the multiplication into a simpler subtraction and multiplication of smaller numbers, making the process quicker.

  - context: |
      The **Ekadhikena Purvena** Sutra ("By one more than the previous one") is used for squaring numbers that are near a base, such as 100. For example, to square 98, subtract it from 100 (getting 2), add the result to 100 (100 + 2 = 102), and finally subtract the square of the difference (2² = 4) from 10000. This results in 9604. This Sutra helps in squaring numbers faster, especially mentally.

      - question: |
          What is the "Ekadhikena Purvena" Sutra used for?
        answer: |
          The "Ekadhikena Purvena" Sutra is used for squaring numbers that are near a base number (like 100), simplifying the calculation by subtracting from the base and adding the difference.
      - question: |
          How do you use the "Ekadhikena Purvena" Sutra to square 98?
        answer: |
          To square 98, subtract 98 from 100 (getting 2), then add this result to 100 (102), and finally subtract the square of the difference (2² = 4) from 10000, resulting in 9604.
      - question: |
          Can the "Ekadhikena Purvena" Sutra be used for squaring numbers other than those near 100?
        answer: |
          Yes, while the Sutra is most effective for numbers near 100, it can also be used for numbers near any power of 10 by adjusting the base accordingly.

      **Vertically and Crosswise** is a technique used for multiplying two-digit numbers. For example, to multiply 23 by 12, the method involves:
      1. Multiply the last digits (3 × 2 = 6).
      2. Cross-multiply and add the results (2 × 2) + (1 × 3) = 4 + 3 = 7.
      3. Multiply the first digits (2 × 1 = 2).
      The result is then 276. This method allows for quick mental multiplication of two-digit numbers.
